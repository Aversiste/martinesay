MARTINESAY(1) - General Commands Manual

**martinesay** - non-configurable thinking jellyfish (and no more)

# SYNOPSIS

**martinesay**
*say*

# DESCRIPTION

The
**martinesay**
utility prints an ASCII picture of a jellyfish thinking something provided by
the user. Jellyfishes are somewhat limited, so complicated thought will be
rejected.
This jellyfish is named Martine and she lives on the Internet. She
haunts various places but you can, for sure, find her here:
http://medu.se.
If you are not from Normandy and thus only like cows then you probably like
Martine.
